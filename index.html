    <p id="para">Tourism has different meanings in different languages and different regions and can be defined in different ways. The present day tourism is not the same as travels of the early periods of human history. In the language of Jewes, the word ‘Torah’ mean study or search and ‘tour’ seems to have been derived from it.</p>
   
    <p id="para">In Latin the original word ‘Tornos’ stands close to it. ‘Tomos’ was a kind of round wheel-like tool hinting at the idea of a travel circuit or a package tour. In Sanskrit, ‘Paryatan’ means leaving one’s residence to travel for the sake of rest and for seeking knowledge.</p>
    
    <p id="para">In today’s world, tourism is an important socio-economic activity. Tourism is now recognised as an industry generating a number of social and economic benefits. It promotes national integration and international understanding, helps in improving infrastructure, creates employment opportunities and augments foreign exchange earnings. Tourism is as much a part of socio-economic development as any other related activity. </p>

    <p id="para">The advanced economies of the west and the emerging economies of south-east Asia underline the linkage between tourism and growth. In any area where a place of tourist attraction is located, there exists a tourist economy besides the domestic area economy. It also lends a helping hand to local handicrafts and cultural activities.</p>

    <p id="para">According to Ziffer (1989), “Tourism involves travelling to relatively undisturbed or uncontaminated natural areas with the specific object of studying, admiring and enjoying the scenery and its wild plants and animals, as well as any existing cultural aspects (both past and present) found in these areas”.</p>
